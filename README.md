# tips_calculator_app_with_admob
First Project after started learning android app development.
This is a simple tip calcuator app where you put the total amount and how much percentage you want to give tips to anyone.
It will calculate the tips amount and the total payable amount including the tips.
I added the admob large banner and Interstitial ad to practice coding for how to integrate admob to any app.
I will update the app by adding a listview under the calculator soon. That listview will contain all the calculation in a list style. 
So that user can check back a month or some days later how much they spend on tips and how mmuch bill they paid in a month.
